# bootstrap-portfolio

##Description 

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This web page showcases my skills, previous challenges (only 2 so far), and provides a way to get in touch with me. I've utilized Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing design. This project followed on from last week's portfolio challenge built only in css and HTML. Bootstrap gave me much more flexibility and more appealing designs and although challenging at first I look forward to using it in the future.
